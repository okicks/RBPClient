<!--
<div *ngFor="let recipe of recipes" (click)="goToDetailPage(recipe)">
    <div>
        <h3>{{recipe.property}}</h3>
    </div>
</div>

Top div creates a list of recipes in HTML
Each element is called "recipe"
Works like a foreach loop
Needs a populated list in the .ts file called "recipes"
-->
<p>recipe works!</p>
