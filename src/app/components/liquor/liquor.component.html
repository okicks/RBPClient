<!--
<div *ngFor="let liquor of liquors" (click)="goToDetailPage(liquor)">
    <div>
        <h3>{{liquor.property}}</h3>
    </div>
</div>

Top div creates a list of liquors in HTML
Each element is called "liquor"
Works like a foreach loop
Needs a populated list in the .ts file called "liquors"
-->

<p>liquor works!</p>
